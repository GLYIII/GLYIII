# Why are you here?
- What are you looking for?
- What do you want from me?

## My name is Gerald Lee Yurek III
  - I am a Electrical Engineering Student at Ohio university.
    - Its not fun, don't do it unless you hate yourself like I do.
    - Specifically I am computer track instead of Traditional EE
      - basically I don't have to take Calc III
      - Also I qualify for a Computer Science Minor with no extra classes
      - And I take more CS Classes than my friends
  - I by Jerry most of the time.
      - Everyone spells my name nickname "Gerry" so I say Jerry like Tom and Jerry.
  - I write alot of Julia and Matlab.
      - I really just want to use Julia instead of Matlab.
      - I write Julia code because I wish it was used more.
      - I wish my professors liked Julia instead of Matlab.
## I use NixOS
  - It has it's ups and downs
  - If you have too many computers syndrome like I do then it's great
      - It's much more efficient than something akin to Arch install script
      - Updating configurations across systems is much less of a headache
      - _MOST_ things don't break all the damn time _Cough, Cough, Julia_
  - If you use some programs that are very dependent on unix paths like Julia then it can be a bitch
      - I have not been able to get graphing and PyCall to work without a lot of fuss
      - GR grahing basicly almost never works
      - I am forced to use Unicode Plots which is fine in _most_ cases
## I will put my config files here so if that's what you are after,
  -  enjoy trying to get my spaghetti config working you lazy fucker
